To run the app, make sure the active directory in MATLAB is in this folder. In the command window, type 'app_automdh' and the app will run.

For RoboDK integration, the RoboDK MATLAB API must be installed. Please refer to https://robodk.com/Matlab-API for this procedure.

The robots tested in the paper are in the saved robots folder and can be loaded to the app by using the menu 'File>Load robot'.
